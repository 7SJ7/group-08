Autonomous parking with Smartcar

Our idea for this project is a smartcar that is capable of autonomous parking in an empty spot when given a command to do so. We are directing our focus on automatic parking functionality and currently have no plans on making manual controls for the car, which will move in random patterm until given a command to park. After receiving such a command, smartcar will change from random movement pattern (if it doesn't stand still) to observing it's surroundings and looking for a possible parking slot. Smartcar at the same time will include obstacle avoidance capabilities (i.e. detecting obstacles in its way as well as on the car's sides).

Goal of this idea is intended for comfortability of the customer and efficiency in performing common everyday task. Autonomous parking aids safety purposes as well. We want to reduce the amount of accidents the cars are involved in and increase its obstacle detection, in order to avoid obstacles in a smarter way.

Components we are going to use:
  - Smartcar shield
  - Gyroscope
  - Speed encoders
  - Bluetooth platform
  - Ultrasonic sensors.
