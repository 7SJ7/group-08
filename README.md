We are going to create a smartcar that is capable of autonomous parking in an empty spot when given a command to do so. Smartcar at the same time will include obstacle avoidance capabilities (i.e. detecting obstacles in its way as well as on the car's sides).
Functionality of the smartcar is intended for comfortability of the customer and efficiency in performing common everyday task. Autonomous parking aids safety purposes as well. We want to reduce the amount of accidents the cars are involved in and increase its obstacle detection, in order to avoid obstacles in a smarter way.
We're going to use smartcar shield, gyroscope, speed encoders, bluetooth platform and ultrasonic sensors.
