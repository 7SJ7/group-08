We are going to create a smartcar that has obstacle avoidance capabilities.
Were creating this for safety purposes. We want to reduce the amount of accidents the smartcar is involved in and increase it's obstacle detection, in order to avoid obstacles in a smarter way.
Were going to use smartcar shield, gyroscope, speed encoders, bluetooth platform and ultrasonic sensors.
